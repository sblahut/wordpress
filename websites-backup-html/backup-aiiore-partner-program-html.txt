The information in this course is not being taught anywhere else at this price or with the ease of online learning which ALSO saves you the cost of air travel, hotels, meals and parking expenses…and the cost of being away from your practice and your loved ones.</div>

<div class="collapsible-partner-content-15">
<div class="partner-content-inner-15">
<br>
You can enroll for LIVE Office Hours with Dr. Nalini Chilkov and receive Exclusive LIVE Mentoring sessions. This is where you can submit cases for review and discussion and submit your questions. If you cannot attend the sessions, you can submit your cases and questions in advance. All recordings will be posted in AIIORE Resource Library for LIVE Office Hours Members only. <br>
<br>

Working with cancer patients is complex. The only way to really learn and develop your hands-on skills is to be able to get help while you are in the trenches with your real patients.  Not only will you learn the same protocols I use in my clinic but you will also learn how I approach a case and a treatment plan and how I individualize care.  <br>
<br>

The LIVE Office Hours are essential.<br>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>When new relevant research is published I will bring it to your attention.</li>
	<li>You will gain an understanding of drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions case by case.</li>
	<li>You will learn how to speak with your patients and with their physicians so that you can develop collaborative relationships and become the go-to referral in your community</li>
</ul>
That’s why I provide support for everyone in the course through the monthly Live Office Hours.
